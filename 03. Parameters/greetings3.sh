read -p "Hello from $(basename $0)! May I ask your name: "  name
echo "Hello Dear $name"
# In the next steps the script will stop until you entered a character.
read -n1 -p "Press any key to exit"
# How it works: 
# -n1 marks the number of characters to introduce (1).
# -p as in former scripts is asking for values for prompt.
# Just when read command get the number of marked characters by prompt
# the script will follow its flow.
exit 0 # Exit with sucess.
